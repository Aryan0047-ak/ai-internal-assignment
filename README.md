## objective of the project
To analyze and visualize violent crime statistics in the top 10 U.S. cities, highlighting their contribution to total violent crimes and comparing crime rates to support decision-making, raise awareness, and identify priority areas for intervention.

## Tools and Libraries Used:
-Programming Language: Python

Google Colab

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis

Matplotlib: For data visualization
## Data Source(s)

https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/umesh.kathar/viz/Crimeratedashboardusingtwodatasets/Dashboard1

The dataset used in the project is containing information about violent crime statistics for U.S. cities.

## Execution Steps (How to run the project)
Install Python (version 3.7 or higher) and the required libraries using the following commands:

bash 

Copy code

pip install pandas matplotlib

Save the dataset file (Top 10 Crime Cities in US_data.csv) in the project folder.

Run the Python script provided in the repository to generate the bar graph.

The output graph will visualize:

The percentage of total violent crime for each city (bar chart).

The absolute violent crime rates (line chart).
## Summary of Results
 kansas City, Indianapolis, Stockton, and Baltimore are among the cities with the highest violent crime rates.

The graph visually highlights each city's contribution to the total violent crime and allows for easy comparison.
## Challenges Faced
Cleaning the data (e.g., converting percentage strings into numeric format).

Creating a dual-axis visualization to compare metrics with different scales.

Ensuring the graph is clear and visually interpretable.
